First we need to initialize variables that will tell
the python interpretor which GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output)
pins talk to our stepper motor drivers...
in other words when we want to send our motor drivers a message,
which pin should we use to send it?
We need three pin for each motor driver:
1) enable pin: when this pin is off (yeah off) the motor is enabled
2) direction pin: when this pin is on the motor will rotate in one direction
    and when it is off it will rotate in the other
3) Step pin: when we turn this pin on, we tell the motor to take a step
    to the next position... we will turn it on and off very quickly
    to make the motors rotate

The rotational angle of one step (step angle) is
1.8 degrees.  This means our motor will complete
one revolution in 200 steps.  360/1.80 = 200.
Since the diameter of our wheel is 13.6 in: then
one inch worth of rotation is defined by 200/13.6.
Therefore 14.7 steps equals one inch... we'll
have to round down until we start half stepping or
micro stepping with our motors.
